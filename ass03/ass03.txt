This assignment tested our knowledge of control structures and made us practice them. We were required to use an infinite loop for the menu. We were also required to use a finite loop to print the name multiple times. Lastly, I used two switch case structures to filter the choice entered by the user.

This assignment also made use of an enumeration and an external class with member functions. Moreover, it also required the creation of a header file and made us include it in our cpp files. Lastly, this assignment also made us compile multiple cpp files into a single executable.

This assignment was helpful in getting familiar with my compiler (clang) and working with multiple files. As always, this file was a bit challenging to write.
