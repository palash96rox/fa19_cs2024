UPDATE 9/25: I saw the feedback on the previous assignment and turns out I have to match the file names cuz cpp and includes dont make sense. Also tried to comment a bunch but the names are quite selfexplanatory.

This assignment expanded on the previous assignment by introducing a real world application of using independent classes and various control structures. We were to simulate a minimal bank account where the user could view or set the balance and deposit or withdraw money.

The assignment required us to create a class with private and public member variables and functions (respectively). We were also required to use getters and setters to access the private variable. The private variable was also updated in various ways, subject to certain conditions.

This assignment was helpful in getting familiar with my compiler (clang) and familiarizing with cpp. As always, this file was a bit challenging to write.
