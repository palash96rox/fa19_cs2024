This assignment expanded on the previous assignment by introducing a real world application of using independent classes and various control structures. We were to simulate a minimal bank where the user could create new bank account and list the existing ones.

The assignment required us to create multiple classes with private and public member variables and functions (respectively). We were also required to use getters and setters to access the private variable(s). We were also required to update the code from the previous assignment for BankAccount and Menu. We worked with vectors and pointers to create multiple accounts and access them. For fun, we also emulated a destructor by creating a clear function and calling it at the end of the program.

This assignment was helpful in getting familiar with my compiler (clang) and familiarizing with cpp. As always, this file was a bit challenging to write.
