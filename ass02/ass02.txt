For this assignment we are required to declare and initialise a Rectangle and make it custom sized. We are to find its area and its perimeter on command and also output the same. Lastly, we are to also check the input for validity (must be non negative). This assignment serves to acquaint us with classes in C++ and how to manipulate them.

The calculations are quite straight forward and can be done without creating separate variables. The only part that we need to be careful of is `setDimensions` as we need to check that the input is non negative. If so, we set the dimensions to 0, resetting the member variables. In the future perhaps we might do error handling for other types of inputs (non integers).

This assignment was helpful in getting familiar with my compiler (clang) and my text editor (VS Code). It was also challenging to write this file but I presume it was get easier as assignments get more complicated.
